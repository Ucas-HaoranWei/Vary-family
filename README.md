## Notes
- ðŸ”¥Vary-document and Vary-plot are two models devised based on Vary-toy. We cannot open-source them, and we only use this project to show the very strong results and discuss them.
- Specifically, Vary-document is a model whose performance is very close to mathpix, and Vary-plot is a model better than Deplot.
